The chatter of my neighbors turned into quiet murmurs peppering the cool air until silence gripped everyone. We stared up at a massive black smudge at the center of the Moon, turning it into an ominous eye. Chills prickled my back. What had landed on the Moon?"

Talking heads in the media stoked fears; endless nutjobs on social networks touted our incoming doom. Others like me simply continued our business under the eye of the Moon, always watching, always infusing fear into our daily lives."

As a Petty Officer in the US Navy, I hungered for real action and thrills. I signed up for the training program without a second’s thought, going against the wishes of my family and friends. How could I ignore an opportunity to become an astronaut solider?"

I couldn’t count the times I wanted to give up and go home, but my heart kept pushing for space and the Moon. Three months later, I was selected along with 1000 other international astronaut soldiers for OPERATION ALIEN BATTLECRAFT. The night before the launch, I stayed up at the window, waiting for dawn, my eyes stuck on the Moon and its new, inescapable neighbor."

Our ascent went as smoothly as expected—even if I was overcome with nausea. But the sight of the Earth and the glory of the stars dissipated whatever stomach troubles I had. Once we approached the Moon, the rear of our ship exploded! We braced ourselves for a crash landing. "

Our orders: proceed to the alien craft and find the team from combat ship X2Y-325. We received their location on our maps. It was time to go. Time to enter the eye on the Moon."
