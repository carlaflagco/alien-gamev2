I couldn’t count the times I wanted to give up and go home, but my dreams kept pushing for space and the Moon. Three months later, I was selected along with 1000 other international astronaut soldiers for OPERATION ALIEN BATTLECRAFT. The night before the launch, I stayed up at the window, waiting for dawn, my eyes stuck on the Moon and its new neighbor."

Our ascent went as smoothly as expected—even if I was overcome with nausea. But the sight of the Earth and the glory of the stars dissipated whatever stomach troubles I had. Once we approached the Moon, the rear of our ship exploded! We braced ourselves for a crash landing."
